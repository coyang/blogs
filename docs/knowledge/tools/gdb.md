# GDB

GDB is a powerful and essential tool for software developers, especially those
working on the Linux platform. It is a command-line debugger that helps you find
and fix issues in your programs during development. The primary purpose of GDB
is to allow you to observe and control the execution of your program while it's
running, line by line, and inspect its state at any point.

Please refer official documentation for details.
