# shfmt

`shfmt` is a command-line tool used by shell programmers to automatically format
their shell scripts. It's designed to make shell scripts more readable,
consistent, and maintainable by applying a set of formatting rules. This can be
especially helpful when working on large projects or collaborating with other
developers, as it enforces a consistent coding style across the codebase.

Here's how you can use `shfmt` to format your shell scripts:

1. **Installation**:

   Before you can use `shfmt`, you need to install it on your system. You can
   usually do this using a package manager like `brew` (on macOS) or `apt` (on
   Debian-based systems). For example, to install `shfmt` using `brew`, you'd
   run the following command:

   ```sh
   brew install shfmt
   ```

2. **Formatting**:

   Once installed, you can use `shfmt` to format your shell scripts. Simply
   provide the path to the script you want to format as an argument. For
   example, if you have a script called `myscript.sh`, you can format it using
   the following command:

   ```sh
   shfmt -i 4 -w myscript.sh
   ```

   In the above command:

   - `-i 4`: Specifies an indentation of 4 spaces. You can adjust this number to
     match your preferred indentation style.
   - `-w`: Writes the changes back to the file.

3. **Automation**:

   Many developers integrate `shfmt` into their development workflows by using
   it in conjunction with version control systems (e.g., Git hooks) or build
   scripts. This ensures that all shell scripts in a project are automatically
   formatted according to the specified rules.


By using `shfmt`, you can easily maintain a consistent and clean coding style
throughout your shell scripts, making them easier to understand and collaborate
on.

Remember that `shfmt` has several options and customization features, so you can
tailor its behavior to match your preferred coding style. To learn more about
these options, you can refer to the official documentation or use the `-h` flag
with the `shfmt` command to display its help information.

```sh
shfmt -h
```

Overall, `shfmt` is a valuable tool for shell programmers to ensure their
scripts are well-formatted and follow best practices in terms of coding style.
