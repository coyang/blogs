# Sphinx

Sphinx is a documentation generator tool used to create technical documentation
for software projects. It is often used in the Python programming community, but
it supports multiple programming languages and allows developers to write
documentation in a markup language and generate various output formats, such as
HTML, PDF, and ePub.
