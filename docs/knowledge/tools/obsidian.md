# Obsidian

## Introduction to Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking and knowledge management application that
leverages the concept of a personal knowledge base (PKB) using Markdown notes.

## How I Use Obsidian in My Daily Work

### Note Organization

Obsidian allows me to create interconnected notes using Markdown, which makes it
easy to structure and organize my thoughts, project details, and code snippets.
I create a separate note for each project, where I can jot down ideas,
requirements, and relevant links.

### Linking and Backlinking

One of the standout features of Obsidian is its ability to create bidirectional
links between notes. This means I can reference and link notes to each other,
creating a web of interconnected information. This is especially helpful for
maintaining context across different projects and topics.

### Code Snippets and Syntax Highlighting

Since we're programmers, I'm sure you'll appreciate Obsidian's built-in code
block support and syntax highlighting. I can easily embed code snippets in my
notes and have them formatted beautifully.

### Daily Logs and Task Management

Obsidian's daily notes feature lets me create a new note for each day. This is
great for jotting down daily to-dos, accomplishments, and thoughts. It helps me
track my progress and stay organized.

## Favorite Plugin: Dataview

One of my favorite plugins in Obsidian is Dataview. It's a plugin that turns
your notes into a powerful database. With Dataview, I can create tables, lists,
and charts directly from the information in my notes. This is incredibly useful
for project tracking, data analysis, and even creating documentation with
up-to-date statistics.

## Tips for Getting Started

1. **Markdown Basics**: Familiarize yourself with Markdown syntax. It's simple
   and will make your notes look neat and well-formatted.

2. **Linking**: Start creating links between your notes. It might feel a bit
   strange at first, but soon you'll see the benefits of easily navigating
   through your personal knowledge base.

3. **Backlinks**: Explore the concept of backlinks. They're like a trail of
   breadcrumbs that lead you back to the sources referencing a particular note.

4. **Custom CSS**: If you're into customization, consider tweaking the CSS to
   give Obsidian a personal touch. There's a supportive community that shares
   CSS themes you can use.

5. **Plugins**: While Dataview is my favorite, Obsidian has a plethora of
   plugins. Explore and experiment with them to find what enhances your
   workflow.

6. **Collaboration**: Obsidian doesn't natively support real-time collaboration,
   but you can still collaborate by sharing Markdown notes through version
   control systems like Git.
