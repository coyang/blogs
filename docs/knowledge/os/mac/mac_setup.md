# My Mac Programming Setup

## Text Editor and IDE

I primarily use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my text
editor and integrated development environment (IDE). It's highly customizable
and has a vast collection of extensions that enhance my productivity. Some of my
favorite extensions include:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python):
  Great for Python development.
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens):
  Provides enhanced Git functionality.
- [Live
  Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare):
  Enables collaborative coding sessions.

## Terminal Emulator

For command-line work, I prefer using the default
[Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) app that comes
with macOS.

It's powerful and supports various customization options. I've set up [Oh My
Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with the
[Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme for a visually
appealing and feature-rich terminal experience.

Another powerful tool is [windterm](https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm).

## Version Control

I rely heavily on [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control. I use both
the command line and the Visual Studio Code interface for managing my
repositories. Additionally, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is
handy for quickly managing Git repositories through a graphical interface.

## Package Managers

For managing programming language-specific packages and tools, I use the
following package managers:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): A package manager for macOS that makes it easy
  to install and manage various software packages.
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/): The package installer for Python.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Virtual Environments

I utilize [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to create isolated
Python environments for different projects. It helps manage project dependencies
and prevents conflicts between packages.

## Documentation

I use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to render the markdown document to html.


### Note-taking

For jotting down ideas, code snippets, and project notes, I use
[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) â€“ a versatile note-taking and organization
tool.

## File Management

I organize my code projects and related files using the default
[Finder](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/welcome/mac) app.
Additionally, [EasyFind](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11076/easyfind) is
tool like [everything](https://www.voidtools.com/zh-cn/) to help me find file
easily.
