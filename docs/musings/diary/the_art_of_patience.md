# The Art of Patience

Some thought when I read the book `<<The Mythical Man-Month>>`.

In our fast-paced modern world, instant gratification has become the norm. We
expect things to happen quickly, whether it's receiving a package within a day
or getting instant responses to our messages. This mindset often spills over
into our daily experiences, where we seek convenience and speed. However,
there is a timeless wisdom that lies in the saying:

> Good cooking takes time.If you are made to wait, it's to serve you better and
> to please you.

In a world where efficiency often takes precedence, we must not overlook the
importance of patience.

We should appreciate the beauty of the process as much as the final outcome.
