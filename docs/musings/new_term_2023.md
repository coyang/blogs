# 2023 New Term

Anna and Fancy, I hope you both had a wonderful summer break filled with fun,
relaxation, and new experiences. It's always bittersweet to see the holidays
come to an end, but a new school term brings its own set of adventures and
opportunities.

I want you both to know how proud I am of the individuals you're becoming.
You've grown so much over the past year, your outcome has already beyond my
scope, and I have no doubt that you'll continue to learn, explore, and achieve
great things this coming term. Remember to stay focused on your studies and
always give your best effort in everything you do.

But also, don't forget to nurture your interests and passions outside of the
classroom. Whether it's art, sports, music, or any other activity you enjoy,
these are important parts of your development too.

Always be kind and supportive to your friends and classmates. Building strong
relationships is just as important as academic success. And never be afraid to
ask for help or share your thoughts and feelings with us. We're here to support
you every step of the way.

As the school term begins, stay organized, manage your time wisely, and never
lose your sense of curiosity and wonder. I have no doubt that both of you will
continue to shine brightly, and I'm excited to see all the amazing things you'll
achieve. Remember, I love you both very much, and I'm here for you whenever you
need me.

Let's make this term a great one together.
