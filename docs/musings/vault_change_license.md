# Thought about Vault change the license

[Background:](https://www.hashicorp.com/license-faq#aug-10-announcement)

HashiCorp announced a transition from the Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPL 2.0)
to the Business Source License (BSL, or BUSL) v1.1 for future releases of all
products and several libraries. HashiCorp APIs, SDKs, Terraform providers, and
almost all other libraries will remain MPL 2.0.

Blew is how I'm thinking about this situation and my plans for the future:

## Exploring Alternatives

Given the uncertainty introduced by the new licensing terms, I'll start
researching alternative open-source solutions for secret management. It's
essential to identify software that aligns with my organization's requirements
and has a licensing model that ensures long-term viability.

## Evaluating Open-Source Options

While looking for alternatives, I'll consider various factors:

- **License:**

I'll pay close attention to the licensing terms of the alternative software. I
want to avoid situations where the license changes abruptly and affects my work
again.

- **Community:**

A vibrant and active community is a good sign of software's longevity and
continuous development.

- **Features:**

The alternative software should offer similar or better features compared to
Vault to ensure a smooth transition.

- **Documentation:**

Well-maintained documentation is crucial for ease of adoption and integration.

- **Security:**

Security is paramount, especially when dealing with secret management. I'll
ensure that the alternative software has a good track record in terms of
security practices.


## In the end

In conclusion, the shift from MPL 2.0 to BSL for HashiCorp Vault has prompted me
to carefully assess my options and make an informed decision about the software
I use for secret management. While this change does introduce uncertainties,
it's an opportunity to explore new solutions that align better with my
organization's needs and provide a stable foundation for my work going forward.
