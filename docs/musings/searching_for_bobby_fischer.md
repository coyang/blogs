# Searching for Bobby Fischer

I watched the movie `<Searching for Bobby Fischer>` today and I regret watch it
so late. This movie should be watched before I have a child, then I will learn
the lessons earlier and not made much mistakes.


## Quotes

###  Every one can be himself

- Vinnie: What's that?
- Josh Waitzkin: Schliemann attack.
- Vinnie: Schliemann attack? Where'd you learn that from, a book?
- Josh Waitzkin: No, my teacher taught me.
- Vinnie: Oh, your teacher. Well, forget it. Play like you used to, from the
  gut. Get your pawns rolling on the queen's side. Come and get me.


### Even

- Josh: Maybe it's better not to be the best. Then you can lose and it's OK.

### Father think his son is the best

- Fred: He's better at this than I've ever been at anything in my life. He's
  better at this than you'll ever be, at anything. My son has a gift. He has a
  gift, and when you acknowledge that, then maybe we will have something to talk
  about.

### Kids want father's love

- Bonnie: He's not afraid of losing. He's afraid of losing your love. How many
  ball players grow up afraid of losing their fathers' love every time they come
  up to the plate?
- Fred: All of them!
- Bonnie: He knows you disapprove of him. He knows you think he's weak. But he's
  not weak. He's decent. And if you or Bruce or anyone else tries to beat that
  out of him, I swear to God I'll take him away.

### So kind boy, his heart full of love

- Bruce: Do you know what it means to have "contempt" for your opponent?
- Josh: No.
- Bruce: It means to hate them. You have to hate them Josh, they hate you.
- Josh: But I don't hate them.
- Bruce: Well you'd better start.

Another scenario is Josh asked his mum about where Vinnie lives and suggest
Vinnie live on his upper berth.
