# The ideal moment to plant a tree is a decade past, followed by the present

As an experienced software engineer with over a decade of professional
experience, today I have registered the domain
[coyang.top](https://www.coyang.top) and established my personal website.

The inaugural blog post features a poignant quote from the esteemed African
female author, Dambisa Moyo, extracted from her notable work titled <Dead Aid>

> The optimal time to plant a tree was ten years ago; the second-best time is
now.

Henceforth, this digital realm shall serve as a repository for my personal
musings and a platform for sharing insights derived from my journey in software
development.
