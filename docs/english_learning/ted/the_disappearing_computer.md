I spent 22 incredible years at Apple, helping to design experiences and devices
ranging from the Mac to the iPhone to the Apple Watch.

我在苹果公司度过了无与伦比的 22 年，参与设计体验和设备， 包括 Mac （苹果电脑）、
iPhone（苹果手机）、 Apple Watch（苹果手表）。

And as the power of compute increased, the size of our computers or our devices
decreased. The desktop paved the way for extraordinary interconnectedness, but
it was stuck to your desk. The laptop provided portability, but you still had to
be sitting down to use it. And the smartphone evolved us into the modern,
connected humans we are, providing millions the ability to access the internet
from our pockets. And the smart watch was a window to that phone. A companion
device with a whole host of health insights, all shrunk down to your wrist.

随着算力的提高，我们的计算机或设备的尺寸也就减小了。台式机为非凡的互联体验开辟了
道路，但它和你的桌面绑定了。笔记本电脑有着便携性，但是你还是得坐下才能使用。智能
手机让我们成为了 如今现代、互联的人类，让成千上万的人 可以从口袋里上网。智能手表
是联通手机的窗口。它作为配套设备，承载了全套健康信息，浓缩在你的手腕上。

But what comes next? Some believe AR/VR glasses like these are the answer, but
they merely move the screens we already have in our lives today to being just
millimeters away from our eyeballs. A further barrier between you and the world.
And the future is not on your face.

接下来会发生什么呢？有人认为答案是像这样的 AR、VR 眼镜，但它们只是把我们生活中已
经有的屏幕挪到了眼球前几毫米的位置。它还是你和世界之间的壁垒。未来不会在你的脸
上。

In fact, in 2017, the legendary tech journalist Walt Mossberg wrote in his final
column that he felt that soon, one day, technology would become invisible. And
that the computer would disappear. And we agree.

其实，2017 年，传奇科技记者莫博士（Walt Mossberg） 在他最后一期专栏里写道，他认
为很快，有朝一日，科技会是无形的。 计算机会消失。我们同意。

(Ringing) (铃声响起)

Sorry. This is my wife. I'm going to have to get this.

不好意思。是我妻子打来的。我得接一下电话。

Hello?

喂？

Bethany Bongiorno: Hey, babe.

Bethany Bongiorno）：嘿，亲爱的。

IC: Hey, Bethany. How's it going?

(ImranChaudhri）： 嘿，贝瑟尼。怎么样？

BB: Good. Are you at TED?

BB: 挺好的。你在 TED 上吗？

IC: Yeah, I'm on the red circle right now, actually.

IC: 嗯，我现在正站在红圈里。

Bethany: Oh, great, good luck. And don't forget to mention me.

贝瑟尼：哦，好的，祝你好运。别忘了提到我。

(Laughter) (众笑)

IC: I won't, babe, thank you.

IC: 我不会忘的，亲爱的，谢谢。

Bethany: Love you.贝瑟尼：我爱你。

IC: Love you, too. Bye.

IC：我也爱你。再见。

It's going to get different in a minute.

一转头就不一样了。

(Applause) (掌声)

So my wife, Bethany, and our entire company, Humane, have been working to answer
the question of what comes next. And you may ask yourself, why? Why would
anybody do this? It's because we love building technology that genuinely makes
people's lives better. And we believe that artificial intelligence or AI would
be the driving force behind the next leap in device design. And there is an
incredible amount of stuff that's happening in this space. Huge, huge
advancements. And even Bill Gates has said of OpenAI's GPT that it's only the
second most revolutionary technology demonstration that he's seen in his entire
lifetime.

我的太太贝瑟尼和我们整个公司 Humane 一直在试图回答接下来会是什么的问题。你可能会
自言自语：为什么呢？怎么会有人在想这个？这是因为我们热爱打造 能真正改善人们生活
的技术。我们相信，人工智能（AI）会促成设备设计的下一次飞跃。在这个领域中，正发生
着令人眼花缭乱的事。很大、很大的进步。连比尔·盖茨都说 OpenAI 的 GPT 是他有生之年
看到过的第二具有革命性的技术呈现。

But what do we do with all these incredible developments, and how do we actually
harness these to genuinely make our life better? If we get this right, AI will
unlock a world of possibility for all of us.

但是有了这些惊人的突破，我们该怎么做呢？ 我们该如何利用它们真正地让我们的生活更
美好呢？如果我们走对了，AI 会为我们所有人打开一扇新世界的大门。

And today I want to share with you what we think is a solution to that end. And
it's the first time we're doing so openly.

今天，我想与大家分享 为此我们心目中的最佳方案。这是我们第一次公开分享。

It's a new kind of wearable device and platform that's built entirely from the
ground up for artificial intelligence. And is completely standalone. You don't
need a smartphone or any other device to pair with it. In fact, I'm wearing one
right now. And it interacts with the world the way you interact with the world.
Hearing what you hear, seeing what you see. While being privacy-first and safe
and completely fading into the background of your life.

这是一款新型的可穿戴设备和平台，从一开始就完全为人工智能打造。也是完全独立的产
品。你不需要一台智能手机 或者其他设备与其配对。其实我现在就戴着一台。它以你与世
界互动的方式与世界互动。听你所听，见你所见。与此同时，它以隐私，安全为先， 并能
完全融入你生活的背景中。

We like to say that the experience is screenless, seamless and sensing, allowing
you to access the power of compute while remaining present in your surroundings,
fixing a balance that's felt out of place for some time now.

我们可以说体验是无屏的、无缝的、感知的，让你可以使用算力，又保证了你在周围环境中
的存在感，弥补了如今有时会出现的违和感。

And I can't wait to share more details about what we've built, and I will in the
next few months. But today I want to talk to you about what it unlocks. And what
it means to be able to take AI with you everywhere. And what happens when
technology increasingly disappears.

我迫不及待想要分享我们做的产品的更多细节，会在接下来几个月内与大家分享。但今天我
想谈论的是这个产品带来的新可能。“可以随身携带 AI” 到底是什么意思。当越来越多的科
技消失的时候，会发生什么。

Technology becoming invisible affords us new opportunities of how we interact
with compute. We've become so accustomed to tapping on an app or moving a cursor
with a mouse that it feels second nature. But that's by design. When I was
working on the iPhone, I used to test interactions like slide-to-unlock with my
infant daughter. She was the best possible focus group. She's 16 now, and she's
got a lot more ideas than she did back then. This also, by the way, is the only
non-AI generated image that you'll see from me today. And as I look at it now, I
see more than ever why a future driven by AI is far better than a future that
would involve more screens. Like this. He's cute, though.

无形的科技给我们带来了与计算机技术互动的新方式。我们已经很习惯点击应用程序，或者
用鼠标移动光标，都是习以为常的事了。但这是有意为之的。我在参与 iPhone 相关的工作
时， 曾和我那还是个宝宝的女儿测试过滑动解锁的交互方式。她是最合适的焦点小组人选
了。现在，她已经 16 岁了，比起当时，她有了更多的想法。顺带一提，这是我今天要展示
的唯一一张不由 AI 生成的图像。我现在看着它，我从未这么强烈地认为为什么由 AI 驱动
的未来 要比充斥着越来越多屏幕的未来要好得多。如图所示。虽然他还挺可爱的。

But for the human-technology relationship to actually evolve beyond screens, we
need something radically different. Let me show you.

但如果人类和科技之间的关系真的要发展到屏幕之外了， 我们就需要一些截然不同的东
西。我给大家展示一下。

Where can I find a gift for my wife before I have to leave tomorrow?

我在明天出发之前应该上哪儿给我太太买个礼物？

(Voice) Vancouver's Granville Island is a lively shopping district.

（语音）温哥华格兰维尔岛是个热闹的购物区。

IC: That's an incredibly simple response for a very complex query. How often do
we find ourselves in a new city, wrestling with our phones, trying not to bump
into people, trying to figure out where we're going and where we're supposed to
be? It's even harder when we don't speak the language, right?

IC: 这可是针对这个非常复杂的询问 给出的非常简单的回答。我们有多少次在一个陌生的
城市， 捣鼓自己的手机，想着不要撞到别人，想要找到自己该去哪里，该在哪里？如果我
们还不会讲当地语言就更困难了，对吧？

Let me show you something. Invisible devices should feel so natural to use that
you almost forget about their existence.

我来给大家展示一下。 “你可以非常自然地使用隐形设备，甚至会遗忘它们的存在。”

(Voice speaking in French) (法语配音)

IC: You'll note that's me and my voice, speaking fluent French, using an AI
speech model that's part of my own AI. This is not a deepfake. In fact, it's
deeply profound. This is my AI giving me the ability to speak any language and
you having a chance to hear me speak that language in my own emotion and my own
voice.

IC: 你能听出这就是我和我的声音， 说着流利的法语， 通过我个人 AI 的一部分的 AI 语
音模型生成。这不是深度伪造（deepfake）。而是意义深远。这是我的 AI 让我说出各种语
言，你能听见我带着自己的情绪和声音说出那种语言。 Thank you.谢谢。

(Applause) (掌声)

This is moving away from the experiments that make us all concerned about the
direction compute is going in. But it's instead using technology to create real,
responsible compute products that are in service to us and built on trust. This
is good AI in action. And we spent thousands of hours reimagining and
redesigning new types of compute interactions, ranging from complex voice
commands to intricate hand gestures, all in service of trying to find more
natural ways to interact with compute. Why fumble for your phone when you can
just hold an object and ask questions about it? The result almost feels like the
entire world becomes your operating system. And when compute disappears, it
allows us to get back to what really matters: a new ability to be present. Like
riding a bicycle in the park and just ripping through emails or going to a
concert without having to hold up your phone to capture it. Or experiencing your
toddler's first steps without a screen between you and your child. In the
future, technology will be both ambient and contextual. And this means
harnessing AI to really understand you and your surroundings in order to achieve
the best results.

这与那些让我们对计算机技术的未来走向担忧的实验不一样。它利用科技 创造真实存在、
负责任的计算产品，为我们所用且建立在信任之上。这是实实在在的好 AI。我们花了上万
个小时重新想象、重新设计新型的计算交互方式，从复杂的语音控制到精细的手势， 都是
为了寻找与计算机技术更自然的互动方式。如果你可以拿着一件物品， 问与它相关的问
题，干嘛还要在你的手机上乱搜一通呢？最终，你会感觉整个世界都变成了你的操作系统。
计算机消失的时候，就能让我们回到真正重要的事上： “存在”的新形式。在公园里骑自行
车的同时也能刷邮件，在听音乐会的时候 不需要举起手机就能拍照。回味你宝宝学会走路
的那一瞬间， 但没有一块屏幕横在你和宝宝之间。未来，科技会融入环境，融入背景。 也
就是说，利用 AI 真正了解你和你的周围环境，达到最好的结果。

Imagine this. You've been in meetings all day and you just want a summary of
what you've missed.

想象一下。你开了一整天的会，你只想要一份你今天错过的所有事项的总结。

Catch me up.

让我赶上进度。

(Voice) Patrick is coming to tomorrow's design meeting. Bethany wants to move
next week's dinner, and Oliver is asking about soccer this weekend.

（语音）帕特里克会出席明天的设计会议。贝瑟尼想把下周的晚餐改期，奥利弗问周末能不
能去踢足球。

IC: These are emails, calendar invites and messages, all surfaced up to the top.
You can use these to help guide your decision making, manage your workload and
sculpt tailored responses in your own voice. And in the context of your life.

IC: 这些都是值得关注的邮件、日程邀请和消息。你可以通过这些信息帮你做出决定，调节
工作量、 生成用你自己的声音说出的定制化回应。与你的生活融为一体。

And we gain this context through machine learning. The more you use our device
powered by AI, the more we can help you in all times of need. Your AI
effectively becomes an ever-evolving, personalized form of memory. And we think
that's amazing.

我们通过机器学习获取这些背景信息。 你越多地使用我们由 AI 驱动的设备，我们就越可
以随时随地为你提供帮助。 你的 AI 真的 成为了一种逐渐进化、 个性化的记忆形式。我
们觉得这太神奇了。

In fact, let's say you're health conscious or you have certain types of food
considerations. Let me just show you. Picked up one of these chocolates. Used to
eat a ton of these when I was a kid.

假设你很关注健康情况，或者你有某些饮食上的注意事项。我来展示一下。拿起一块巧克
力。我小时候吃了无数巧克力。

Can I eat this?

我可以吃这个吗？

(Voice) A milky bar contains cocoa butter. Given your intolerance, you may want
to avoid it.

（语音）牛奶巧克力里有可可脂。 根据你的不耐受性，你可能不该吃这个。

IC: So I can't eat these anymore.

IC：所以我不能再吃这些了。 (Applause) (掌声)

But what's cool is my AI knows what's best for me. But I'm in total control. I'm
going to eat it anyway. (Laughter)

厉害之处就是我的 AI 知道什么对我是最好的。但我说了算。我还是要吃。(众笑)

(Voice) Enjoy it.

（语音）吃吧。

(Laughter) (众笑)

IC: Your AI figures out exactly what you need. And by the way, I love that
there's no judgment. I think it's amazing to be able to live freely. Your AI
figures out what you need at the speed of thought. A sense that will ever be
evolving as technology improves too.

IC: 你的 AI 会搞明白你到底需要什么。 顺带提一句，我喜欢没人评头论足。自由地活着
太好了。你的 AI 在一念之间就能搞清楚你需要什么。 一种随着科技的进步， 也会进化的
感觉。

And these examples are just the start. As AI advances, we will see how it will
transform nearly every aspect of our lives. In ways that will seem unimaginable
right now. In fact, Sam Altman from OpenAI feels the way we do. And that AI is
grossly underestimated. And I'll add, so long as we get it right.

这些例子只是个开始。随着 AI 的发展，我们会看到它如何改变我们生活中的几乎方方面
面。以一种眼下难以想象的方式。OpenAI 的山姆·阿尔特曼 （Sam Altman）和我们有一样
的感觉。AI 被远远低估了。但我想补充一句，我们还是可以做出对的选择。

We really believe that we're only beginning to scratch the surface of what's
possible. Embed advancements of AI, like in our device that's actually built to
disappear and allow experiences to come forward, and we open up entirely new
possible ways of how you interact with technology and how you interact with the
world around you. More humane, intuitive interactions that are screenless,
seamless and sensing. This is so much more than devices just getting smaller or
more powerful. This is the possibility of re-imagining the human-technology
relationship as we know it. And that's what's so exciting.

我们真的相信我们只看到了可能性的冰山一角。将 AI 的进步嵌入为了消失而存在的设备
中，让体验更近一步，我们就开创了你与科技交互、你与周围世界交互的全新方式。更人性
化、更直观的互动，无屏的、无缝的、感知的。这比设备越来越小、越来越强要有意义得
多。这给了我们新的可能， 重新思考我们所知的人与科技之间的关系。这就是令人兴奋之
处。

It's a huge challenge, no doubt. But it's the world that we want to live in. One
where technology not only helps you get back into the world but enhances our
ability to do so. It's within reach. And you saw some of it today.

这当然是个巨大的挑战。 但这就是我们想身处其中的世界。 在这个世界里，科技不仅让你
能重回世界，还能增强我们这样的能力。它触手可及。你今天看到了其中的一部分。

The future will not be held in your hand, and it won't be on your face either.
The future of technology might almost be invisible.

未来不会在你手中，不会在你脸上。科技的未来几乎会是隐形的。

Thank you.谢谢。

(Applause) (掌声)
